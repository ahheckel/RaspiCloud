# RaspiCloud
Simple script-based, Raspberry-Pi hosted cross-platform Cloud with ssl-encrypted Web Interface.

## Features
  Syncs client directories automatically to private cloud storage with
  on-the-fly categorization of synced files (audio, video, documents and pictures)
  and thumbnail generation. Guest access possible.
  No 'rooting' of android devices is required.
- *lightweight:* based on *OpenSSH*, linux tools 'rsync', 'cron' and bash scripts
- *secure:* ssh-based file transfer (key-based encryption)
- *convenient:* nginx ssl-encrypted web interface for file browsing with image gallery functions (see screenshots)
- *cross-platform:* client-side linux environment available on many platforms
- *low cost:* using Raspberry-Pi as server with standard USB storage as NAS 

## Requirements
- linux server (tested with Raspian Stretch on a Raspberry Pi 3b+) 
- nginx web server (1.10.3) and OpenSSH server (7.4)
- NAS storage (tested with low cost 2.5 inch portbale, ext4-formatted USB-Harddisk attached to the Raspberry Pi)
- imagemagick v6 and libreoffice v5 for thumbnail generation (server-side)
- client requires termux (android) or cygwin (windows) environment

- a file manager with ssh support (e.g. mxeplorer, solidexplorer and others under android support key based authentication and are available on google playstore)
- a standard webbrowser on the client, e.g. firefox
