# RaspiCloud
Simple script-based, Raspberry-Pi hosted cross-platform Cloud with ssl-encrypted Web Interface.

## Features
- syncs client directories automatically to cloud storage
- automatic categorization of synced files in audio, video, documents and pictures
- automatic thumbnail generation
- guest access possible
- no 'rooting' of android devices required
- *lightweight:* based on *OpenSSH*, linux tools 'rsync', 'cron' and bash scripts
- *secure:* ssh-based file transfer (password protected or key-based)
- *convenient:* nginx ssl-encrypted web interface for file browsing with image gallery functions (see screenshots)
- *cross-platform:* client-side linux environment available on many platforms
- *low cost:* using Raspberry-Pi as server with standard USB storage as NAS 

## Requirements
- linux server (tested with Raspian Stretch on a Raspberry Pi 3b+) 
- nginx web server (1.10.3) and OpenSSH server (7.4) installed
- NAS storage (tested with low cost 2.5 inch portbale, ext4-formatted USB-Harddisk attached to the Raspberry Pi)
- imagemagick v6 and libreoffice v5 for thumbnail generation (server-side)
- client requires termux (android) or cygwin (windows) environment

- a file manager with ssh support (e.g. mxeplorer, solidexplorer and others under android support key based authentication and are available on google playstore)
- a standard webbrowser on the client, e.g. firefox

## Installation
### Install Client:
  **Raspbian Server:** 
  - create directory for client-installation files under a privileged user's account (e.g., 'pi'):
  
    ```mkdir ~/client-install-files```
    
  - copy the files in *RaspiCloud/server* to *~* and the files in *RaspiCloud/client-install-files* to *~/client-install-files*.   
  - copy private/public keys of privileged user to *~/client-install-files/ssh* (and remove them after installation is finished).
  
  **Android Client:**
  - Install Termux app (see google playstore).
  - open Termux and install openssh:
  
    ```pkg install openssh```
  
  - copy install script from server:
  
    ```scp pi@IP-ADDRESS:client-install-files/install_client.sh $HOME/```
    
    ```chmod +x $HOME/install_client.sh```
  
  - execute it:
  
    ```./install_client.sh```
  
  - after that, create new ssh keypair:
  
    ```ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f id_rsa```
    
    and update authorized_keys on server.
   
### Install Nginx Web-Server for File Browsing:
  - install nginx and openssl, apache2-utils (for htpasswd), imagemagick & libreoffice (for thumbnails):
    
    ```sudo apt-get install nginx openssl apache2-utils imagemagick libreoffice```
  - create self signed certificate for ssl encryption:
   
    ```sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/nginx.key -out /etc/nginx/nginx.crt```
    
    to become a certificate authority (optional, useful in local networks) follow these steps: https://reactpaths.com/how-to-get-https-working-in-localhost-development-environment-f17de34af046
  - choose www-root-directory and link to NAS storage, e.g.
   
    ```sudo ln -s /media/cloud-NAS /var/www/html/cloud```
  - copy .css, .js, .xsl(t),... files in *RaspiCloud/nginx/webroot/cloud* to *www-root/cloud*
  - create user/password pair:
   
    ```sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd USER```
  - adapt nginx 'default' configuration file in */etc/nginx/sites-available* (see example in *RaspiCloud/nginx/sites-available*)
  - restart nginx:
   
    ```sudo service nginx restart```
