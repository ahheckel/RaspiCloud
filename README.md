# RaspiCloud
Simple script-based, Raspberry-Pi hosted cross-platform Cloud with tls/ssl-encrypted Web Interface.

## Features
  Syncs client directories automatically to private network access storage (NAS) with
  on-the-fly categorization of synced files (audio, video, documents and pictures)
  and thumbnail generation. Prints documents remotely via CUPS. Guest access possible.
  No 'rooting' of android devices is required.
- *lightweight:* based on *OpenSSH*, linux tools *rsync*, *cron* & bash scripts
- *secure:* using key-based encryption
- *convenient:* tls/ssl-encrypted web interface with instant search and image gallery functions for mobile browsing (see screenshots)
- *generic:* sftp-access supported by many file browsers (incl. Windows10 Explorer)
- *cross-platform:* client-side linux environment available on many platforms
- *quick-install:* using command line script (~10 min)
- *low cost:* using Raspberry-Pi as server with standard USB drive as network access storage (NAS)

## Requirements
- linux server (tested with Raspian Stretch/Buster on a Raspberry Pi 3b+) 
- nginx web server (v1.10.3) and OpenSSH server (v7.4)
- CUPS server (v2.2.10) for remote printing
- NAS storage (tested with low cost 2.5 inch portbale, ext4-formatted USB-Harddisk attached to the Raspberry Pi)
- imagemagick (v6), libreoffice (v5) & ffmpeg (v3.2.14) for server-side thumbnail generation
- client requires termux (tested on android 7/8) or cygwin (windows) environment

- a file manager with ssh support on the client (e.g. mxeplorer, solidexplorer and others under android support key-based authentication, see google playstore)
- a standard webbrowser on the client (e.g. firefox, opera, chrome)

    ```scp pi@IP-ADDRESS:RaspiCloud-master/install/install_client.sh $HOME/```
    
    ```chmod +x $HOME/install_client.sh```
  
  - execute it:
  
    ```./install_client.sh```
    
   
### Install Nginx Web Interface:
  **On Raspbian Server:**
  - open a terminal and make install-script executable:
  
    ```chmod +x ./RaspiCloud-master/nginx/install_nginx.sh```
  
  - execute it: 
    
    ```./RaspiCloud-master/nginx/install_nginx.sh```
  
  **On the Client:**  
  - go to *https://IP-ADDRESS/cloud/USER*, enter *USER*'s credentials and browse your cloud.

### Install CUPS:
  **On Raspbian Server:**
  - open a terminal and make install-script executable:
  
    ```chmod +x ./RaspiCloud-master/nginx/install_cups.sh```
  
  - execute it: 
    
    ```./RaspiCloud-master/nginx/install_cups.sh``` 
    
  - install printers using the CUPS-webinterface
